1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Be2 O-O 6. O-O {As against many
other openings in which Black refrains from an early occupation of the centre
with pawns (for instance several Sicilian systems and the King’s Indian),
the set-up based on Nf3, Be2 and 0–0 is named the ‘Classical System’.
White does not claim a refutation of Black’s hypermodern play, but relies on
the fact that natural development should oﬀer him chances for a minimal, yet
stable, middlegame advantage.  Black is under no immediate pressure, but needs
to complete his development and prepare his counterplay in the centre, most
typically with ...e7-e5. Over the next few moves he should constantly be aware
of White’s potential threats of e4-e5 and, less frequently, d4-d5.  It is
worth mentioning that mastering this variation with Black is equivalent to
understanding the Pirc in general, as the strategic ideas typical of the
Classical System are useful in most other positional set-ups. Black has a
relatively wide choice between viable variations. I have selected for our
repertoire:} c6 {This has not only been the most popular  answer over many
decades, but is also the one corresponding best to the classical spirit of the
opening. The last move is useful in many ways. What frst comes to mind is the
potential threat ...b7-b5. Black should not hurry with it, since in most cases
e4-e5 would leave him underdeveloped and with a vulnerable queenside. But if
White does not take measures against it, it will not be long before the pawn
can advance safely, gaining queenside space and preparing ...Bb7, while
indirectly attacking e4.  Another important idea behind 6...c6 is to clear the
a5-d8 diagonal for the queen. On his way to prepare ...e7-e5 (and inhibit
e4-e5) Black frequently needs ...Qc7 (and sometimes ...Qa5), while if the
white bishop develops actively to, say, g5, then ...Qb6 could cause some
problems defending d4 and b2.  In this chapter we will examine the early break
A) 7.e5, the developing moves B) 7.Bf4, C) 7.Bg5 and D) 7.Re1, and finally the
prophylactic pawn move E) 7.h3.  The main line, 7.a4, is the subject of the
next chapter.  I should say a few words about move orders, as transpositions
are frequent. When examining  lines B, C and D, I will not consider an early
a2-a4 or h2-h3, as these transpose to lines examined in either line E or the
next chapter.  I will add a few words about my approach when building up the
repertoire. Over the years when the Pirc was my exclusive weapon, I almost
invariably answered all these moves with 7...Nbd7, even though I knew that in
some lines 7...Qc7 enjoys the reputation of being a worthy alternative. When
making my choice I let myself be guided by the classical principle that the
queen should be among the last pieces to develop. But in recent years I have
discovered the virtues of 7...Qc7 in the lines where White does not focus on
preparing e4-e5 (line E and the next chapter). If Black manages to carry out ..
.e7-e5, it is in many cases useful to retain the possibility of ...Bg4, which
sometimes induces White to spend a tempo on h2-h3.} 7. Be3 {You may wonder why
this most natural developing move is not on the list above. The reason is that
it allows:} b5 $1 8. e5 {The standard reaction to an early queenside expansion,

positions.  The lines based on a quick e4-e5 are slightly irritating, as they
take Black out of the usual Pirc patterns. Objectively, there is no great
danger, but Black needs to know what he is doing for a short sequence of moves.
Small details may change the nature of Black’s best reaction – compare for
instance variations B and D, where Black reacts quite differently to White’s
Bf4.  When White aims for straightforward development, Black will respond with
...e7-e5.  We have already seen some examples of this, and will see many more

The most consistent lines are those aiming for development and restricting
Black’s possibilities, particularly  variations C and D. However, Black is
able to neutralize the initial pressure and obtain good chances for
counterplay with an accurate move order. Te main idea is to play ...e7-e5,
force the exchange on e5 and then regroup optimally, bringing his knight(s)
close to the f4- and d4-squares and solving the problem of the a7-pawn.} *

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. h3 O-O {The most obvious idea of
White’s last move is to prevent ...Bg4. This is important if play transposes
to the Classical System with Be2 within the next few moves (for instance 6.Be3
c6 7.Be2 or 7.a4 followed by 8.Be2).  For players intending to meet the
Classical Variation with 6...Bg4 or systems other than 6...c6 this could be a
problem, but fortunately this is not the case for us.  However, delaying the
f1-bishop’s development has another more subtle idea. If Black plays in the
spirit of the lines from Chapters 1 and 2, based on ...e5, White could
exchange on e5 followed by Bf1-c4, developing the bishop on the most active
diagonal without wasting time. This would ensure a lasting initiative based on
Black’s slight delay in development.  Another way of developing the bishop
is Bd3, allowing the quick knight transfer ¤c3-e2-g3, reaching a regrouping
typical of closed variations in the Ruy Lopez. For this plan preventing ...Bg4
is essential, since Qxf3 usually destabilizes White.  Finally, 5.h3 ensures
some stability for the dark-squared bishop on e3 (and, in some cases, f4 or g5)
by preventing ...Ng4.  The absence of this potential threat is also relevant
if White plays e4-e5 at an early stage. However, rushing in with the central
advance leads nowhere:} 6. e5 dxe5 7. Nxe5 (7. dxe5 Qxd1+ 8. Kxd1 Rd8+ 9. Bd2

cannot be parried easily, for instance:} 9. c4 Qe4+ 10. Be3 c5 {White is
underdeveloped and his position is hanging.}) 8... Nxc3 9. bxc3 Nd7 {Followed
by ...c5 soon, with no worries for Black at all.  .   Of course, spending a
tempo on a pawn move so early causes White some delay in development but, as
we will see, Black has to react accurately in order to take advantage of this
detail.  We will start by investigating A) 6.Be3, which is by far the main
move. In the corresponding section I will present both sides’ main ideas and
the types of structure Black should avoid or strive for, respectively.  Te
minor alternatives B) 6.Bg5 and C) 6.Bf4 are only partly similar, as Black can
(and in the latter case should) meet these with diﬀerent plans.  Finally, D)
6.Bc4 is not recommended, as it allows Black to disrupt the white centre at
once.  A) 6.Be3  The most natural move, strengthening control of the d4-square
and preparing to set up the queen-and-bishop battery along the c1-h6 diagonal.
I recommend choosing the same set-up as against the Classical System with:  6..
.c6   The start of a familiar plan, involving fghting for space with ...e7-e5
and ...b7-b5. However, Black has to choose the move order with care in order
to avoid the position opening up in White’s favour.  Before looking at the
specifc variations, I would like to give a selection of typical positions that
can arise in this line. Here is a classic example of how things can go wrong
for Black:} *

Conclusion  From the lines examined in this section, only A is really
important. For players having 6...Bg4 or moves other than 6...c6 in their
repertoire against the Classical System, the main line examined in this
chapter may cause some problems. But since 6...c6 was our choice in Chapters 1
and 2, the 5.h3 line transposes to the same type of position, with the
difference (favouring Black) that White has committed his h-pawn a bit earlier
than he might wish. Just compare with Chapter 2, in which White does his best
to omit h2-h3 and Black needs to use accurate move orders to provoke it!} *

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. f4 Bg7 {From the frst moment I became
interested in the Pirc Defence, I have always thought that the Austrian Attack
is the most challenging system. White builds up a massive pawn centre,
creating the positional threat of e4-e5, which in many cases leaves Black with
a cramped position and oﬀers White chances for a direct attack against the
king.  Black’s thematic break in the centre with ...e7-e5 is more
problematic than in other systems, so he frequently resorts to ...c7-c5. After
the centre stabilizes with d4-d5, White can consider the consistent attack
based on Qe1-h4, f4-f5, Bh6 and Ng5.  The only drawback of this system is that
it slightly delays White’s development, allowing Black to fght against the
centre by dynamic means. White received a serious warning about the dangers
awaiting him if he treats the centre superfcially in one of the first recorded
games with the Pirc Defence:} 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Bd3 Nbd7 7. e5 Ne8 8. O-O c5 {
White has not sustained his initial aggression with h2-h4, or e5-e6 followed

fight and activating the black knights.} 9. exd6 Nxd6 10. dxc5 Nxc5 {With

backed up by my excellent results in the lines 5...0–0 6.Bd3 Na6 followed by

is equivalent to giving up hope of taking advantage of White’s delayed

Conclusion  Even though other systems may have been more popular in recent
years, I cannot avoid considering the Austrian Attack the main challenge
against the Pirc. The lines covered in this chapter, however, are not the most
critical, although it is important to know how to react to 5.a3 and 5.Bd3 to
avoid being lured into lines outside our repertoire.  While 5...c5 is a
logical reaction to 5.Nf3, it can lead to a wide range of interesting
positions. The less common 6.d5 and 6.Be2 lead to Schmid Benoni and Dragon
positions, but with f2-f4 played somewhat prematurely, resulting in good
versions for Black.} *

major strategic drawback: after the inevitable bishop exchange, White’s
light squares will be weak, creating the risk that his position becomes
overextended.  One possible problem for ambitious players is that White can
force a draw in line B3, though when playing against an inferior opponent, one
could always deviate with the suboptimal 8...Bxb5 9.exf7† Kf8.  For many
years I feared that the forced lines in this chapter would be hard to work out
and keep up to date, but now I see their inner logic, which makes their
handling easier for tournament players.} *

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Be3 {This fashionable system corresponds to a
general tendency in hypermodern openings, including, among others, the English
Attack in the Najdorf and Scheveningen Sicilians, and various Be3 set-ups
against the King’s Indian.  White’s main idea is 5.Qd2 followed by
castling queenside, leading to mutual attacks on opposite wings.  In the Pirc
Defence, this set-up has an even clearer target than in the aforementioned
lines, since Be3-h6 will weaken the black king’s defence, making the attack
based on f2-f3 and h2-h4-h5 as dangerous as in the Sicilian Dragon.  At the
same time, 4.Be3 is ﬂexible enough to allow switching to positional schemes,
so Black should choose his antidote to the main plan carefully.  For years my
main choice has been 4...c6. Delaying the bishop’s development is logical,
as it inhibits Bh6, when ...Bf8xh6 would gain a tempo over the lines with an
early ...Bg7. Moreover, there are many situations where the bishop proves
useful on the a3-f8 diagonal. For reasons explained on page 221 (line B of
Chapter 9), I temporarily abandoned 4...c6 but, while working on this book, I
managed to regain full confdence in it.} {Before moving on, I will brieﬂy

line, to which I have been unable to find an antidote.} Bxh6 7. Qxh6 {White
does not have concrete threats yet, but Black’s king is stuck in the centre.
On the other hand, the queen’s departure from the centre offers Black a free
hand on the queenside and, as we know, the bishop exchange mainly favours
Black strategically.  Apart from the natural queenside expansion, Black could
consider a kingside blockade on the dark squares, based on ...Rg8 and ...g5,
causing the enemy queen some discomfort.} Qa5 8. Bd3 c5 {This is Black’s
main source of counterplay but, even during the games I played with this line,
I had my doubts as to whether Black can really equalize after wasting two

Conclusion  Due to its character being both aggressive and ﬂexible at the
same time, 4.Be3 is one of White’s most troubling systems. With the
ﬂexible 5.Nf3, White plays in the style of Chapter 3, and may transpose
there if he plays h2-h3 in the near future. In this chapter, we concentrated
on line where White tries to manage without h2-h3. However, we saw that  in
various lines Black can effectively use the availability of the g4-square with
either ...Ng4 or ...Bg4, although I would stress that the accurate timing of
these moves is important.} *

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. g3 {This solid variation involves a similar
approach to that of the Classical System. White does not put immediate
pressure on the centre, but hopes that natural development will offer him a
long-term edge. The system involves a slower development  than the Classical,
since White has spent two tempos on developing his king’s bishop, but on the
other hand the e4-pawn is safely defended, thus neutralizing the attempts at
counterplay based on ...exd4 and ...Re8.} Bg7 5. Bg2 O-O 6. Nge2 {The
seemingly more active 6.Nf3, which transposes to variation B of Chapter 4, has
the drawback of allowing a pin to be created by 6...Bg4. The text move avoids
this problem but creates a new one: Black can start fghting for central space
unhindered.} e5 {Plans based on ...c5, starting with 6...Na6 or 6...Nbd7, have
enjoyed temporary bursts of  popularity, but I find the immediate break in the
centre the most logical.  During my long years as a Pirc player, I have always
met the fanchetto system with the plan examined in this chapter. Black has
several alternatives along the way, but I do not see any reason to deviate
from my favourite plan. Black will play 7...c6, threatening to expand with ...
b5. After the logical a2-a4, Black has a ﬂuent developing plan: ...a5, ...
Na6-b4, ...Be6-c4, ...Qc7 and ...Rad8. In order to get a better understanding
of the way I have organized the analytical material, it is important to know
that the following main tabiya is examined in line B2, and all its subsequent
branches. Even though Black does not threaten to break in the centre before
completing his development, White cannot fully enjoy his space advantage,
since his e2-knight is passive, restricting the mobility of the major pieces
at the same time. Activating the knight is  essential but also time-consuming,
usually allowing Black to obtain counterplay in one way or another.  All the
lines I examine in the frst part of the chapter are early White attempts to
gain some beneft from omitting h2-h3 or a2-a4. While a  small delay in playing
the former usually leads to a transposition, refraining from the latter
generally oﬀers Black excellent play after ...b5.  Returning to the position
after 6...e5, since Black is not yet threatening a queenside expansion, White
has a choice between A) 7.0–0 and B) 7.h3.} 7. O-O {White keeps developing
without paying attention to the g4-square. Since Black’s set-up suggested in
variation B is ﬂexible and consists of a long series of moves, I do not see
any reason to deviate from it. I believe that White will have to play h2-h3 at
some later point anyway, thereby transposing to the main lines.} c6 ({The

factors apply if White plays f2-f4, as otherwise play may transpose to more

the most troublesome variations for me. I have only faced it on rare occasions,

that I could improvise over the board. In practice, this policy worked out
well, but it could hardly satisfy the purpose of a repertoire book, so I
eventually came up with a coherent antidote, which I will present below.  It

The minor lines examined in this chapter are characterized by early White
aggressiveness at the cost of neglecting the natural course of development.
This tends to offer Black counterplay earlier than he would expect when
playing the Pirc.  The most consistent of the options is variation B, aiming
for a solid kingside expansion, but its slowness offers Black the time to
start his own pawn play.} *

favourable route due to the early advance of the f-pawn. Another negative

than satisfactory. However, this would mean examining a heavily analysed

path.  The merits of the text move are not only subjective. Black speeds up
his development, which is a logical reaction to White’s ‘slow mode’
implied by f2-f3. Later, the bishop may get onto the long diagonal with ...Bf6,
without the usual kingside weakening entailed by ...g6.  Moreover, the bishop
can occasionally venture to h4, causing White some problems with coordination.
White experiences the usual Sämisch microproblems with his development. The
main issue is finding a good square for his king’s knight, but this also
involves taking a decision regarding the king’s bishop. Since he has not
played Nb1-c3 yet, White can try to reach a ﬂexible set-up with Ne2-c3,
followed by either Nd2, or a2-a4 and Na3. But this is rather time-consuming,

Conclusion  3.f3 is a sound move, potentially causing some move-order problems
to players who do not have the King’s Indian or the Benoni in their
repertoire against 1.d4.  However, from all the possible answers to 3...c5,
only 4.d5, covered in line D, maintains White’s ﬂexibility. The 
alternatives are likely to cause problems with the ﬂuency of White’s
development. While transposing to a f2-f3 Benoni is a good option for Black,
the pseudoBenoni lines examined above are entirely viable, offering good
prospects for unbalanced middlegame play with chances for both sides.} *

Now that White has a choice, it is the right moment to talk about the
similarities with, and differences from, the Open Spanish. Due to Korchnoi’s
efforts, in his matches with Karpov and later in the 1980s, the following
Spanish line became very topical, and it has not lost its relevance in modern
times:  1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0–0 Nxe4 6.d4 b5 7.Bb3 d5 8.
dxe5 Be6 9.c3 Nc5 10.Bc2 Bg4 11.Re1 In our Pirc line, Black regains the tempo
spent on twice pushing his d-pawn by moving the queen’s bishop directly to
g4. The main difference is that in the Pirc, his queenside pawns are on their
initial squares. Superficially, this is a drawback, since in the Ruy Lopez
these pawns guarantee Black some queenside space advantage, but on the other
hand ...b5 entails a serious weakening. White can typically cause problems
with a2-a4, while after Nd4,  ...Nxd4, cxd4, the c5- and c6-squares are weak.
Moreover, in some lines based on ...d4, the knight on c6 is hanging after Be4.
Concretely, the most important additional option for Black in the Pirc is
queenside castling, thus neutralizing White’s typical kingside attacking
plans based on his strong Spanish bishop.} Ne6 $5 ({Most games have continued
with} 9... Be7 10. Re1 {reaching the aforementioned transposition. However, I
would prefer to take full advantage of the absence of queenside weaknesses by
focusing on castling on that side.}) 10. Re1 Qd7 $146 {This is typical of the
Ruy Lopez, where its main idea is to consolidate the d5-pawn with ...Rd8,
strengthening the threat of ...d4 at the same time. In the Pirc, I recommend
it as a way of preparing queenside castling, thereby placing the rook on d8
anyway and transferring the king into safety.} 11. Nf1 ({Anticipating
queenside castling with} 11. b4 {is parried by} a6 {leaving White exposed to ..
.d4, when the b4-pawn would be hanging.}) ({The other possible Ruy Lopez plan
is:} 11. h3 Bh5 12. Nb3 O-O-O 13. Bf5 {A typical move, aiming at weakening
Black’s control over the d4- and c5-squares. The latter is less threatening
than in the Ruy Lopez, since here the c5-square is less weak.} Be7 14. Qd3 (14.

Conclusion  This is only of only a few parts of the book where Black
completely deviates from normal Pirc patterns. While I may be a little
subjective as an experienced Open Spanish player, there is no doubt that the
early reaction in the centre is the best way to meet White’s delaying his
knight’s  development.  The main fresh idea in the variations I examined is
Black’s possibility of castling long, either before opening the centre, as
in line B1, or after it, as in line B2. Generally speaking, Black achieves
counterplay more easily than in the Spanish, and in a more active way than in
the normal Pirc lines.} *

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nd2 {As hard as I tried to cover all White’s minor
lines when writing The Pirc Defence, this somehow escaped my attention. The
move is quite rare and I have faced it just once, but my opponent’s play was
so unambitious that my only reason for discontent was the final result – a
draw.  However, 3.Nd2 is not a bad move, as Black can do no better than
transposing to a line of the Modern Defence (for example, 1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.
Nf3 d6 4.c3). Tiger Hillarp Persson covers this in The Modern Tiger and is
more or less justified in calling it the “Lazy Variation”, but it is of 
course right that I should give my own interpretation of these positions.  I
should start by saying that by developing the queen’s knight so soon, White
deprives himself of the active Bg5, which is typically played in the most
ambitious version of the “Lazy” Modern. It is also worth mentioning that
this line can be reached via the move order 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 g6 3.Nbd2 Bg7 4.e4

1. e4 d6 {Apart from the opening’s general character, another important
factor that induced me to add the Pirc to my repertoire was that White has
virtually no possibility of steering me away from my favourite schemes.
Against the Sicilian there are numerous lines, such as 2.c3, 3.Bb5(†) or 4.
Qxd4, that lead to completely different play than in the main systems. We have
a similar situation after 1...e5, when Black has to travel a long way before
reaching his preferred line, for instance the Breyer or Zaitsev systems.  In
the Pirc, White has no way to prevent his opponent from implementing his
intended fanchetto set-up, but by refraining from 2.d4 he can try to play in
the spirit of the Closed Sicilian. This is not really unpleasant for Black, as
the Closed Sicilian (or reversed English) schemes do not put pressure on him,
so I see no reason to refrain from ...c5 in the near future.  The Closed
Sicilian has been examined in several Quality Chess books. Experts on the
Anti-Sicilian, edited by Jacob Aagaard and John Shaw, and Grandmaster
Repertoire 6A – Beating the Anti-Sicilians by Vassilios Kotronias, have a
Closed Sicilian repertoire for Black, while The Modern Tiger by Tiger Hillarp
Persson, gives lines for Black after 1.e4 g6 2.Nc3 Bg7, answering both 3.f4

with e2-e4, f2-f4, d2-d4 and c2-c3, as in the main line of variation B, allows
Black active counterplay.  I find the Closed Sicilian approach (g2-g3, with or
without a knight on c3) the most consistent, as featured in the notes to lines
A and B, but these are the kind of positions that I find pleasant playing with
either colour.} *

{The Petroff Defence has traditionally been regarded as a reliable defensive
mechanism to counter the aggressive} 1. e4 {. It also has a reputation for
being one of the most drawish of all openings and a choice that Black only
makes when content to achieve a draw. However, in recent years, this has all
changed. A new generation of players, spearheaded by the 2018 World
Championship challenger, Fabiano Caruana (whose qualification route was built
heavily around the Petroff), are re-interpreting this ancient defence. While
recognising the impressive solidity of the Petroff they are honing it into a
fine counter-attacking weapon.} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {. 'Opening Repertoire: The
Petroff Defence' examines all aspects of this highly complex opening and
provides the reader with well-researched, fresh, and innovative analysis. Each
annotated game has valuable lessons on how to play the opening and contains
instructive commentary on typical middlegame plans. The suggested lines for
Black are based around the very latest games and analsysis.} (2... Z0 {Cyrus

{What is Your Opening Utopia? --- In the foolishness of youth I took a vast
dislike to the Petroff, a hateful creature with no perceivable reason to exist,
other than to annoy} 1. e4 {players. I tended to sneer at the opening, a
nondescript, faceless line for snivellers whose only goal in life was to draw
a chess game. However, with old age comes wisdom, and today I understand the
strength of the Petroff. The Petroff is not an opening for wild expectations;
a draw is just fine. And if our opponent gets overly ambitious, overstretches
and loses, then even better. If 1 e4 is the chessboard's Count Dracula, then
the Petroff Defence is our Dr. Van Helsing, since the Petroff has the ability
to drain the life out of White's aggressive intentions. --- There is a faint
sense of taunting with} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {: "I'm here in my fortress. Come
after me if you wish." The Petroff has no pretensions of trying to
complicate and gain an advantage with Black, as in sharper openings such as
the Sicilian lines the Najdorf, Sveshnikov and Dragon. With the Petroff Black
seeks equality or even near-equality and works from there for either the half
point, or the full point if the opponent gets carried away (and they often do).
--- The Petroff is the perfect opening for those who wish to postpone the
major battle to the middlegame. It is also close to being impervious to
computer analysis. Petroff players can be confident of keeping their
opponents' computer analysis at bay, since the Petroff's inherent solidity
protects from the unpleasant (computer-aided) shocking new moves in the
opening.} *

{When we embrace the chess games of a great player whose style is similar to
ours, the great player is a mirror of what we could have been, had we been
gifted with vastly greater potential. Petroff devotees play over Fabiano
Caruana's Petroff games the way a person of faith touches the hand of a saint.
He has almost single-handedly brought the opening back to the forefront of
popularity. Caruana, the modern day Botvinnik, is proof that greatness arises
via hard work, rather than innate talent (although I have a feeling Caruana's
innate talent level is also pretty high).} 3. Z0 {Caruana revived the Petroff
through his success with the line, coupled with his uncanny ability to produce
an endless stream of new ideas within the opening. Carlsen tried taking on a
pair of Petroffs in their 2018 World Championship match and essentially wasted
two Whites, since Caruana was never in danger in either game. In fact, Carlsen
came rather close to losing one of them. Both of these games are in the book.
The goal with the Petroff is that we don't want to lose. All other results are
acceptable. Here are some typical positions we encounter.} *

{With} 3. d4 {we enter into the Scotch Petroff, which generates the most open
positions seen in this book. We can reach the following positions:} Nxe4 4.
dxe5 Bc5 {. The Petroff is solid and therefore sometimes unfairly accused of
being dull. Petroff players often choose the opening with the sole ambition of
being able to secure a draw with the black pieces. But be warned. If you go
after them with a sharp line such as this one, you are just as likely as they
are to lose a few teeth in the fight. White has three ways to deal with the
attack on f2:} 5. Z0 ({a)} 5. Bc4 {– ignore it and go for a counterattack on
f7.}) ({b)} 5. Qd5 {– ignore it and attack the loose e4-knight, which
supports the c5-bishop.}) ({c)} 5. Be3 {– after which Black exchanges and
damage White's structure, at the cost of creating an open f-file for a White
attack.}) *

{Here, Black responds with a far safer version of the Scotch Petroff by playing
} 4... d5 5. Nbd2 {, and now Caruana recently uncorked} Qd7 $1 {. --- "Main
line" usually translates to "played by a majority", which is in turn
based on the false belief that the majority is always right. Caruana's
shocking last move, 5...Qd7!, is another way to play against the Scotch
Petroff. The idea is that it negates White's strategic threat of Nxe4 and
Qxd8+. We grope our way through our openings, until they finally become
routine and that is where the thinking process stops. We live our lives in
comfortable patterns. Remove the routine and our opponent instantly gets
disoriented. --- In one respect it is a monumental act of ego to think that we
alone can find a new move which improves upon generations of precedent, yet
Caruana did just that when he banged out a completely original idea with his 5...Qd7!. This move completely unsettled his grandmaster opponent and Caruana
won rather easily. There is no such thing as classified information in chess.
Eventually, everyone gets to view everything. But for now, Caruana's new idea
is a bit under the radar, at least at club level, so I have a feeling you will
surprise others and win games with Caruana's move.} *

{If we relate chess to the Planet of the Apes, then Petroff players are the
refined, intelligent chimpanzees, while their Cochrane Gambit-loving opponents
are reminders of those thuggish, warmongering gorillas. --- However, if you
dislike irrational complications, then don't assume you will easily escape
them by playing the Petroff. In a single turn, with} 4. Nxf7 $5 {the veneer of
polite civilization vanishes. At first we look upon such complications with
the unfocused stare of a newborn infant and the sacrifice is one designed to
numb our side with terror. I promise you that, if you work on it, this piece
sacrifice won't exert the desired effect. With time and study come familiarity
and confidence. When we analyse the line with a computer, the Cochrane Gambit
doesn't appear nearly as scary as it does at first sight.} *

{Here we feature two positions where all is calm. Yes, these positions are
rather dull, but does every opening, especially when we are playing the black
pieces, have to be full of flavour and excitement? If the main goal is to
achieve equality, then the answer is clearly "no". I assure you that the
Petroff is the big, meek kid, once afraid of his own shadow, who suddenly
decides to assert himself by approaching the school bully with the intent on
giving him an unexpected bruising. Why does the big, meek kid win the fight?
Because the bully never sees it coming and, when the challenge arises, the
bully is completely unprepared for a counterattack.} 1. Z0 {I played Petroff
in online blitz games while I was writing this book and was stunned to
discover that I hadn't lost a single Petroff – even to titled players – in
a full month of online play. I can't even come close to making such a claim
with any other opening, as Black or White. One curious trait was that I drew
many, many games to players far lower-rated, often by as much as 300 points.
The people who I tended to beat were titled players, who were not interested
in a draw. So the Petroff is the opening which can beat the big kid. It's the
little guy who often holds the draw. --- Although the Petroff is one of the
most – if not the most – solid opening system against 1 e4, is it really
suitable for the higher-rated player? The answer is "no", but only if you
are desperate for a win with the black pieces. It isn't all that hard to hold
a draw as White, if a lower-rated opponent wants one. So my suggestion is that
the Petroff shouldn't be your only opening against 1 e4. Have an alternative
ready for situations where you are the higher-rated player, or are in a
must-win situation.} *

{In this position, the physical characteristics are not quite identical, since
White has one extra move. Is it enough for an edge? I doubt it.} 1. Z0 {
It is because of lines such as this that the Petroff is regarded as an opening
for players who prefer dull chess. Anyone as White who chooses to play in this
tedious way against the Petroff is obviously in love with the colour grey.
This deadly dull line can also arise from the Exchange French. Is it really so
terrible to be handed equality so early in the game if you play the black
pieces?} *

{By recapturing away from the centre with} 6. dxc3 {, White attempts to
balance structural responsibility with enhanced activity. A position may be
terribly complicated, yet its rules may be very simple. In this case, opposite
side castling often occurs and the plan is usually to mate the opponent before
you get mated yourself. I call this the New Main Line. White duly hopes for a
position of opposite castling. Black will usually castle kingside (though not
always), while White castles long. Black's chances are fully equal in this
more exciting version of the Petroff.} *

{This is the starting position of the main line, where White's main choices
are:} 8. Z0 ({a)} 8. c4 {– undermining the e4-knight.}) ({b)} 8. Re1 {
– which directly threatens the e4-knight.}) ({c)} 8. Nc3 {– and after the
exchange, White is willing to accept structural damage, in return for an open
b-file and a strengthened centre.}) ({The Exchange French-like position may
look simple, but I assure you that it isn't. Theory, especially in the} 8. c4 {
line, runs deep and can be dangerous unless you thoroughly master the line's
subtleties. The structure of the Main Line tends to resemble that of the
Exchange French, yet the Petroff is a clever forgery. Why? Because of a single
factor: the e4-knight, which is both a strength and a weakness. It's a
strength since one of Black's pieces is ensconced in the opponent's territory
and may even later be backed up with ...f7-f5. It's also a weakness since,
with c4 – White's most principled line – the knight is in danger of being
undermined.}) *

{Moloch was the biblical Canaanite god/idol to which small children were
regularly sacrificed as an appeasement offering. The sacrifice of material in
order to go after our opponent's king is the chess world's Moloch. The heart,
combined with dubious faith, has the power to overcome common sense which is
why some of your opponents are going to sacrifice a piece on the fourth move.} 
4... Z0 {Just know that the Cochrane Gambit is somewhat dubious and you have
excellent chances of reeling in the full point, as long as you do your
homework. Be warned though: unprepared Petroff players routinely get mugged,
shot and knifed in the Cochrane Heights neighbourhood. Don't underestimate the
gambit, since we don't get it all that often (except in blitz, where we get
hit with it all the time). This factor means that, when someone actually does
play the line, we may forget the theory. Also remember: there is the study of
a line and then there is the actual act of playing it, which is vastly
different. So, go through this chapter as a regular rotation of your Petroff
theory. I don't believe the gambit is fully sound, yet I'm not at the point
where I'm willing to mock it, either.} *

the lotus posture, in the attitude of a Zen master. That is how unworried I am
about White's sacrifice. Our opening has been forged in the fire of centuries
of practice, so it isn't about to be magically refuted on the fourth move.
There are two directions we can run: 1) Away from something. --- 2) Towards
something. --- With 4 Nxf7!?, White is clearly choosing number two on the list.
On a scale from 1 to 10, White dials it up to an 11 with an immediate piece
sacrifice. Forget about respectable convention and welcome to the slightly
shady, yet dangerous, Cochrane Gambit. For the piece White gains the following
compensation: 1) Two strong central pawns. --- 2) Black's king loses the right
to castle and may later come under attack. --- Is it sound? I doubt it since
not only is Black up a piece for two pawns, we also have the following in our
favour. --- 1) We are not behind in development. This factor keeps our king
safer than appearances suggest. --- 2) Our king may be out and about but our
position is solid and weakness free. --- However, remember that over-the-board
play is always messier than controlled study at home. If you know your stuff,
you should emerge with an advantage against Cochrane Gambit.} Kxf7 {Our

milquetoast version White isn't willing to allow the bishop or knight into f2.

space and open f-file make up for the self-inflicted structural damage. This

even emerges with a slight edge, in every line.} Bxe3 6. fxe3 d5 $1 {We

last move Black allows White to eliminate a potentially weak e5-pawn. In

an open mind and search for the new. Caruana finds an effective new move,
which has been repeated several times since. It may be the most important
novelty of 2018 (at least for us Petroff folk). Outwardly, this geometrically
anomalous move violates the following principles: 1) Don't move your queen out
early in the game, especially in an open position. --- 2) Don't deliberately
clog your development routes. --- 3) Don't fall behind in development in the
opening. --- Shockingly, White is unable to exploit all three violations of
principle. The idea behind the jarringly atonal move is that it negates
White's threat to take on e4 and then play Qxd8+. I can't find a way for White
to even reach a small edge after Caruana's idea. --- You may wonder whether
Black's queen effectively clogs Black's queenside. It doesn't. Black plays to
unravel as follows with ...c7-c5, ...Nc6, ...b7-b6 and ...Bb7, with harmonious
queenside development.} ({In the next game we look at the older move} 5... Nc5

{Study can be tedious, yet we get through it with the thought that we will one
day wield it as a weapon in our tournament games. In this chapter – by far
the biggest in the book – you may be facing your most daunting theoretical
test, since the lines all look similar, but there are always subtle
differences and it is not at all easy to make out their individuality.} 8. Z0 {
When White faces the Petroff, there are many ways to chicken out of a
theoretical fight and simply opt for a safe and easy-to-learn line. Not so in
the main line, where theory spirals deeply. From my observation very few of my
Petroff students face the main line at club level, since their club-level
opponents are nervous about entry into the theoretical maze, even though it is
the main choice of titled players. So, somewhat annoyingly, you must study the
living daylights out of this taxing chapter in order to be ready for those few
times you actually do face it. --- On the plus side, the best White gets is
something between equal and a slight edge, which means the Petroff wall should
hold against whatever White throws at you.} *

more alive, and experience heightened sensations compared to our normal
neutral mode. --- This weakening move at least fuels White's "I'm
attacking" narrative. Is this last move premeditated or an action of impulse
and opportunity? To my mind White's chances of going off the cliff feel a lot
higher than his chances of a successful kingside assault upon Black's king.}

{One thing the Carlsen-Caruana World Championship match proved is that the
rating system is accurate. The players were only separated by three points
which, statistically, is a virtual tie. So the 6-6 draw in the classical
portion of the match was no great surprise. There was not a single decisive
game. --- This is game six. Carlsen got nowhere with his English and Queen's
Pawn openings, so he dared to open with 1 e4, knowing perfectly well that he
would face Caruana's Petroff. In this game Caruana equalized effortlessly and
almost won the game.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nd3 {It is testimonial
to the Petroff's power that Magnus Carlsen threw away a White in order to
surprise Caruana with this lame sideline, rather than challenge him with a
main line. It's an unwise bet to test Caruana's preparation since he
completely blunted Carlsen's surprise variation.} Nxe4 5. Qe2 Qe7 6. Nf4 {

while White mistimed his own space gaining and later overextended. The ideas
behind this move are: 1) Black plans to meet Ng5 with ...Bd5, when White is
denied a c3-c4 option. --- 2) Black will unravel with ...Nb6, ...Qd7 and ...Re8. --- 3) Black gains some useful queenside space, to counterbalance White's

the h-pawn is allowed through to h6), resulting in weakened dark squares
around Black's king. --- 2) With a pawn on h4, White may later play either Bg5
or Ng5. In the latter case, if Black responds ...h7-h6 then White may be able
to ignore the threat and offer the knight as bait to pry open the h-file. ---

Why put the bishop on f4, when the more stable e3-square is available? For the
following reasons: 1) On f4, White fights for the e5-square. This is important
because it makes it harder for Black to play freeing ...Ne5 ideas later on.
--- 2) On e3, the bishop can be vulnerable to Black's ...Nc6, ...Ne5 and then
either ...Nc4 or ...Ng4 ideas. --- On the flip side, on f4 the bishop is in
the way of White's future pawn storm ideas, since it blocks the f-pawn. On e3,
White can play Nd4 and then immediately push the f-pawn to the fourth rank.}

Nc3 Nxc3 6. bxc3 {This line is a rare guest from the White side. In this
variation, which is played far less often than 6 dxc3, White follows the
principle: capture towards the centre. The differences between this version
and the main line 6 dxc3 are: 1) White doesn't get an open d-file. --- 2)
White can't really contemplate castling queenside, which is the norm in the 6
dxc3 version. --- 3) White gets a pawn preponderance in the centre. --- 4)
White gets an open b-file for a rook. This means that Black is far less
tempted to castle queenside, since it would endanger the king. --- 5) White's
a-pawn is isolated and the central structure is vulnerable to ...c7-c5 and ...Qa5 ideas. It is, in general, weaker than in the 6 dxc3 version. --- 6) The
inferiority of White's structure means that most exchanges will be in Black's
favour, since each one takes the situation closer to a pleasant ending.} Be7 7.

aggressive square where it prevents ...d6-d5 (which, as we've seen, Black

At first sight it seems as if Black will be destined for a long defensive
struggle, but this assessment is incorrect. Black stands just fine here for
the following reasons: 1) He has promising play on the g-file. --- 2) The dark

clamp on the e4-square.} 23. Re3 Nf8 $1 {The knight is effectively transferred
to g6, where it keeps Black's king safe by gumming up the g-file, and also
applies pressure to White's f4-pawn.} 24. Rfe2 ({After} 24. Rg3+ Ng6 25. Qf6
